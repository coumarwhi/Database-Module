EXERCISES

1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

A: Pro: A linked list never contains empty placeholders. Each node is independent in memory, so the operating system may use any available memory location to store it, which allows linked lists to easily grow to immense sizes.
Con: Inefficient to access an element within the list, because each node may exist anywhere in physical memory. 

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

A: Browsing history of web browser.

PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS

1. The Linked List push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Find the bug and fix the code.

LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
 SET node = {
   value: element,
   next: null
 }

 IF the head node does not exist
   THEN SET head to node
 ELSE
   SET current node to head
   SET current.next to null
 }
}

2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

A: 

FUNCTION remove duplicates
  IF head = null OR next = null 
    Return NO DUPLICATES FOUND
  ENDIF

  FOR LOOP checking for any repeat of first Node 
    IF repeat node 
      Node temp = middle.next
      middle.data = temp.data
      middle.next = temp.next
      delete duplicate node. 
    ENDIF
    REPEAT IF starting at second node
    ...
    ... 
  ENDFOR
END FUNCTION  

3. Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

FUNCTION reverse linked list

    previous = NULL
    current = head node
    next = current.next
  THEN
    next = current -> next
    current -> next = previous
    previous = current
    current = next
  THEN
    head = previous

END FUNCTION
