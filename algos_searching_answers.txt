EXERCISES

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Finding a name in an unordered list. 


2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Finding a name in a sorted list. 
 
3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: It would take 7 iterations. 

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: It would take 2 iterations. 

5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: I would choose linear because you cannot effectively use binary search with an unordered list as there is no way to tell if the value you were looking for is below or above the mid. 

6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: I would use binary search because you would be able to cut the search length down significantly with each iteration when using a sorted list. 


PROGRAMMING 

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A: 
function findWord(word, dictionary) {
  var low = 0;
  var high = dictionary.length -1;
  var mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
  
  while (dictionary[mid] != word && low < high) {
    if (word < dictionary[mid]) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else if (word > dictionary[mid]) {
        low = middle + 1
    }
    mid = Math.floor((high + low) / 2)
  }
}

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A:
function findFish(fish, totalFish) {
  for(var i = 0; i < totalFish.length; i++) {
    if (totalFish[i] === fish) {
      console.log("I found the fish!")
    } else {
      console.log("It's not this fish.")
    }
  }
}

findFish('white-spotted goldfish', ['neon tetra', 'guppy', 'goldfish', 'white-spotted goldfish'])
