SHORT ANSWER

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	A: To express what code should do without using a particular language. It's a way 	to brainstorm before actual coding. 
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
	A: Nothing will happen. It is for humans, not for a computer to actually run. 


PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION greatestNumber (number1, number2)
  IF number1 is greater than number2
    PRINT number1
  ELSE number 2 is greater than number 1
    PRINT number 2
  ELSE
    print "The two numbers are equal"
  END IF
END FUNCTION 	

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FUNCTION to100
  Set initial number to 1
  WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
    PRINT number
    Increase number by 1
  ENDWHILE 
END FUNCTION 

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION nameSearch(name, phonebook)
  FOR loop through elements in phonebook 
    IF name === phonebook element
      PRINT name + " is in the phonebook"
    ELSE 
      PRINT name + " is not in the phonebook"
    ENDIF 
  ENDFOR
END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function nameSearch(name, phonebook) {
  for(i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
    if(phonebook[i] === name) {
      return name + " is in the phonebook"
    } else {
      return name + " isn't in the phonebook"
    }
  }
}
