EXERCISES

1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

- Making coffee;

Grab coffee beans
Pour beans into coffee grinder
Grind the beans
Pour ground beans into French Press 
Pour hot water into the French Press until filled to the line.
Put lid on French Press 
Wait 4 min
After 4 min is up, press down on French Press top
Press until mesh cannot go down any farther
With lid still on, pour coffee into mug

- Washing dishes;

Grab sponge
Turn on hot water
Put sponge under hot water until wet
Grab dish soap
Pour a few drops of dish soap onto wetted sponge
Grab dirty dish
Scrub dish with sponge until clean
Turn on hot water
Rinse dish under hot water until soap is removed
Place dish onto drying rack


- A choice of your own.

FEEDING THE CAT

Grab canned cat food
Grab can opener 
Open can with can opener
Grab bowl
Place contents of can into the bowl
Set bowl down onto the floor 
Throw can away

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A: Facebook: algorithm that prioritizes "meaningful interactions" from family and friends through facebook feed. 
Netflix: predicts shows and movies user would want to watch. 
LinkedIn: prioritized relevant content to user. 

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

A: an efficient algorithm should be consistent in successful predictions and continue to learn. This allows for more relevant data and more user satisfaction.
